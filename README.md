Everything in between 

Hello Peeps, so good to have you on my page and I hope you will enjoy coming on this journey with me. I created this site so that I can share my experiences, my joys, my struggles with you. As a black african woman living in the 21st century, we've come far but there are still a lot to be done. So this is a safe space where everyone will be respected. So if you are a racist, homophobe, racist, bigot, sexist move along. You are not welcome here, move along.

So if you want to learn more, explore more or just have a lovely time, you are on the right page.
