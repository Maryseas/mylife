Everything in between

Hello Peeps,

So good to have you on my page and I hope you will enjoy coming on this journey with me. I created this site so that I can share my experiences, my joys, my struggles with you. As a black african woman living in the 21st century, we've come far but there are still a lot to be done. So this is a safe space where everyone will be respected. So if you are a racist, homophobe, racist, bigot, sexist move along. You are not welcome here, move along.

So if you want to learn more, explore more or just have a lovely time, you are on the right page.

Without much further ado, let's get right to it. My firs post will be about something fun (before getting into the heavy subjects)
